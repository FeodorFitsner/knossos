=  KNOSSOS V3.4.1 - Change Log   =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image
data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and
connectivity. 


----------------------------------
-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: February 22, 2013

Homepage: http://www.knossostool.org/ and

----------------------------------
- Known Issues                   -
----------------------------------

- Delay after launching the installer
	
	Windows only:
	There are reports that the installer sometimes requires several minutes to launch. Please
	just wait a few minutes or restart Windows in case nothing happens after double clicking it.
	We are investigating the problem.

----------------------------------
-  Bugfixes                     -
----------------------------------

- Fixed issue of Knossos not launching if a configuration file was corrupted

- Fixed incorrect incrementation/decrementation in the "Active Node ID"-widget

- Fixed crashes of synchronised Knossos instances

----------------------------------
-  New Features / Enhancements   -
----------------------------------

- New Rendering Engine

    Skeletons are displayed in KNOSSOS V3.4 with a new rendering engine that allows the fluent
	handling of skeletons with several 100k nodes. It is based on a heuristic level-of-detail
	algorithm that downsamples the spatial skeleton graph dynamically, dependent on the current
	zoom level applied by the user. The new rendering engine should also make KNOSSOS much more
	stable on older graphics cards (esp. compared to 3.2).

- Better Rotation in Skeleton Viewport

	Rotating the 3D skeleton with the mouse is now based on a rolling-ball rotation model.

- New shortcuts for "walking" and "jumping" through the dataset:

	[d]/[f]: move x steps backwards/forwards in the direction of the active viewport.
		x can be specified in the walkframes widget under "Navigation Settings"
	[d]/[f]+[SHIFT]: move 10 steps backwards/forwards in the direction of the active viewport 
	[e]/[r]: move walkframes*y steps backwards/forwards in the direction of the active viewport.
		 y can be specified in the jumpframes widget under "Navigation Settings" 

- Added SHA-2 checksums for skeleton time and idle time

- Added widgets to the nodes tab for modifying the active node's coordinates

- Adjusted idle time tolerance.
