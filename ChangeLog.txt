=  KNOSSOS V3.3 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image
data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and
connectivity.

----------------------------------
-  Bugfixes                     -
----------------------------------

- Removed many memory leaks
- Fixed OpenGL display list problems that lead to unstable behavior on many computers
- Fixed defective recentering on node
- Fixed incorrect incrementation/decrementation in the "Active Tree ID"-widget 

----------------------------------
-  New Features / Enhancements   -
----------------------------------

- Massive performance improvements and better visual quality while handling
  large skeletons (5k-500k nodes) through a completely reworked rendering
  engine (view frustum culling, dynamic level-of-detail algorithm, large vertex batches)
- Adjustable position and size of viewports
- Conditional radii and highlighting (coloring) of nodes based on a set of definable comment strings
- Python starter now remembers the last opened folder or starts in the Knossos folder
- Improvement of Skeleton Viewport rotation  ----- [TODO: specify what has changed]
- Added Buttons to rotate Skeleton Viewport by 90 and 180 degrees.
- Recentering on a very distant node is performed by a jump instead of a smooth move.
