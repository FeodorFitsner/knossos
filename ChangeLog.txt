=  KNOSSOS V3.2 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity.

----------------------------------
-  Bug fixes                     -
----------------------------------

- State of checkboxes show the correct value
- Window sizes stable after main window resizes
- Fixed tree color bug in synchronized mode
- Fixed flickering viewports at coordinates that are multiples of 128
- Fixed jumping to last branch node
- Fixed: New node connected to active tree after deleting tree


----------------------------------
-  Features                      -
----------------------------------

- Advanced tracing modes: The user has the possibility to use the tracing modes 
	Additional viewport direction mode 
	Additional tracing direction mode
	Additional mirrored move
- Tracing time window shows the KNOSSOS running time, the tracing time and the idle time
- User can save comments and add them to a node by pressing [F1] - [F5]
- Added shortcuts
	Go to next/previous node via [x]/[Shift]+[x]
	Go to next/previous tree via [y]/[Shift]+[y]
	Move 10 layers in/against viewport direction via [e]/[r]
	Quit KNOSSOS via [ALT]+[F4]
	Save file via [CTRL]+[s]
	Connect/disconnect nodes via [ALT] + [mouseleft]/[rightclick]
	Change zoom in skeleton viewport via [i]/[o] when mouse is in skeleton viewport
- Reset button in skeleton viewport resets to default view
- Skeleton viewport settings are now saved in skeleton file
- User can load LUT-Files to use own color schemes for the microscopy data
- User can restore default preferences
- Physical size of the microscopy data displayed in a viewport can be shown
- Microscopy data can be stored in inverse cube order (z first) on hard drive


----------------------------------
-  Changes                       -
----------------------------------

- Larger field of view of data viewports (displaying twice as much data for M==3 with the same cube loading times) at the expense of a bit less buffering
- Size of viewports adjusted
- The usability of selecting nodes in skeleton viewport is improved
- User has to confirm before he delets a tree
- Limited recentering time to 5 seconds
- Improvements in saving/autosaving/loading files and user settings
- Coordinates can be read in (pasted from other applications) with other seperators
- Sliders for bias/range delta
- KNOSSOS launcher updated to be compatible with Phyton 3 (Python 2.x still supported)
