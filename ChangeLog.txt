=  KNOSSOS V3.2 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image
data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and
connectivity. 


----------------------------------
-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: October 11, 2012

Homepage: http://www.knossostool.org/ and
http://code.google.com/p/knossos-skeletonizer/


----------------------------------
-  Bugfixes                     -
----------------------------------

- Checkboxes represent the correct state
- Window sizes stable after main window resizes
- Fixed flickering viewports at coordinates that are multiples of 128
- Fixed jumping to last branch node
- After deleting a tree, the next new node is added to the active tree
- Newly created and saved skeleton files also appear in recent files
- Skeleton file paths containing dots are handled correctly
- If default skeleton files folder (skeletonFiles in knossos install
  directory)) is missing, it will automatically be created on a save
  event
- Titlebar updates correctly when skeleton is cleared

----------------------------------
-  New Features / Enhancements   -
----------------------------------

- Support for dynamic switching between datasets sampled at different
  resolutions ("multires")
- Advanced tracing modes: The user has the possibility to use three different
  tracing modes: Additional viewport direction move mode, Additional tracing
  direction move mode, Additional mirrored move mode
- Tracing time window shows the KNOSSOS running time, tracing time and idle
  time
- Users can bind comments to the [F1] - [F5] keys to easily add them to nodes
- Nodes with comments now appear in yellow. But branch nodes with comments 
  remain blue.
- Added shortcuts: Go to next / previous node via [x] / [SHIFT] + [x]; Go to
  next/previous tree via [y] / [SHIFT] + [y]; Move 10 coordinate units via
  [e] / [r]; Quit KNOSSOS via [ALT] + [F4]; Save file via [CTRL] + [s];
  Connect / disconnect nodes via [ALT] + [left click]; Change zoom in skeleton
  viewport via [i] / [o] when mouse is in skeleton viewport
- Reset button in skeleton viewport resets to default view
- Skeleton viewport settings are now saved in skeleton file
- Skeleton colors can be defined in a lookup table
- User can reset preferences to default
- Physical size of the microscopy data can be displayed in the viewports
- Microscopy data can be stored in inverse cube order (z first) on hard drive
- Larger field of view of data viewports (displaying twice as much data for
  supercube edge 3 with the same cube loading times) at the expense of a bit 
  less buffering
- Size of viewports adjusted
- Selecting nodes via [Shift] + [left click] selects nodes within a radius from
  the mouse click position
- Tree deletion requires confirmation
- Limited recentering time to 5 seconds
- Improvements in saving / autosaving skeleton files: Saving a skeleton without
  the ".nml" extension will automatically add the extension to the file name;
  Empty skeletons can not be saved; Trying to save an unchanged skeleton asks
  for confirmation
- More state information is saved in user settings
- Coordinates delimited by various separators can be pasted from other
  applications
- Sliders for bias / range delta
- KNOSSOS launcher and synchronizer updated to be compatible with Phyton 3
  (Python 2.x still supported)
- Python starter will give a warning when launching knossos without
  selecting a dataset
- Unsuccessfully loading a skeleton does not clear the old skeleton
- Changed shortcuts: Connect / disconnect nodes via [SHIFT] + [middle click]
