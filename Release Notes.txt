==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of 
neural morphology and connectivity.

- Important new Features         -
----------------------------------

- Advanced Tracing Modes
	In previous versions KNOSSOS centers to a newly added node (in work mode "link with activce node"). KNOSSOS V3.2 provides the 
	possibility to use three new tracing modes where not the newly placed node is centered, but the area where the next node is to be expected. The options for this new feature can be found in "Preferences", "Navigation Settings".
	1) Additional viewport direction move mode: KNOSSOS moves a user-given number of layers in the direction of the clicked viewport 
	2) Additional tracing direction move mode: KNOSSOS moves in the direction given by the vector between the previous node and the active node, but twice as far as the vector's length.
	3) Additional mirrored move mode: same like 2), but with a user-given number of layers.

- Shortcuts
	A few shortcuts were added to make the handling of KNOSSOS easier:
	1) The user can move to the next or previous node via [x]/[SHIFT]+[x] and to the next or previous tree via [y]/[Shift]+[y].
	2) If the user has no mousewheel the zoom of the Skeleton Viewport can also be changed via [i] and [o] while the mouse is inside 
	   the Skeleton Viewport. Nodes can also be connected or disconnected via [ALT] + [mouseleftclick]. The possibility of connecting
	   and disconnecting nodes with the mousewheel is now simplified to the key combination [SHIFT] + [mousewheelclick].
	3) With [e] and [r] the user can move 10 layers in the direction of the mouse selected viewport.
	4) The Skeleton File can be saved via [CTRL]+[s].
	5) KNOSSOS can be quitted via [ALT]+[F4].

- Default Preferences
	1) The user has the possibility to restore the default preferences of KNOSSOS by clicking on "Preferences" and "Default Preferences" in 
	the menu bar.
  2) The reset button in the skeleton viewport resets to the default view.

- Comment Boxes
	Up to 5 frequently used comments can be saved into comment boxes. With the shortcuts [F1] - [F5] the comments can then be easily added to a node. The comment box window can be opened by clicking "Windows" and "Comment Shortcuts" in the menu bar.

- Tracing Time Window 
	This feature allows the user a better time management of the tracing sessions: 
	1) Running time: This is a continous counter which displays how long KNOSSOS has been running. It starts when KNOSSOS starts.
	2) Tracing time: This is the time which shows the working time of the user.
	3) Idle time: This time shows how long the user has not been working in KNOSSOS, that is running KNOSSOS without using it.


- Larger field of view of data viewports (displaying twice as much data for M==3 with the same cube loading times) at the expense of a bit less buffering
