=  KNOSSOS V3.2 - Release Notes  =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data and was developed
for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity.

- Important new Features         -
----------------------------------

- Advanced Tracing Modes

    KNOSSOS V3.2 provides three new tracing modes in which the user is automatically moved
    futher along the current tracing direction when a new node is added.
    The options for this new feature can be found in "Preferences" -> "Navigation Settings".
    1) Additional viewport direction move mode
       KNOSSOS moves a specified distance orthogonal to the clicked viewport
    2) Additional mirrored move mode
       KNOSSOS moves in the direction given by the vector between the previous node and the
       active node, by the same amount as the previous move
    3) Additional tracing direction move mode: same as 2), but with a user-specified
       distance.

- Shortcuts

    1) The user can move to the next or previous node via [x] / [SHIFT] + [x] and to the next or
       previous tree via [y] / [SHIFT] + [y].
    2) The Skeleton Viewport zoom factor can be changed via the [i] and [o] keys when the
       mouse pointer is inside the Skeleton Viewport.
    3) Nodes can be connected or disconnected via [ALT] + [left-click]. The possibility of
       connecting and disconnecting nodes with the mousewheel is now simplified to the key
       combination [SHIFT] + [middle-click].
    4) The [e] and [r] keys move by a distance of 10 orthogonally to the viewport that contains
       the mouse pointer.
       The speed can be set through "Recentering Time orthog. [ms]", which can be found under
       "Navigation Settings".
    5) The Skeleton File can be saved via [CTRL] + [s].
    6) KNOSSOS can be quit via [ALT] + [F4].

- Default Preferences

    1) The user has the possibility to restore the default preferences of KNOSSOS by clicking on
       "Preferences" -> "Default Preferences" in the menu bar.
    2) The reset button in the skeleton viewport resets to the default view.

- Comment Shortcuts

    Up to 5 frequently used comments can be bound to the [F1] - [F5] keys.  The comment shortcuts
    window can be opened by clicking "Windows" -> "Comment Shortcuts" in the menu bar.

- Tracing Time

    This feature allows a better time management of the tracing sessions.
    1) Running time
       This is a continuous counter which displays how long KNOSSOS has been running. It starts when
       KNOSSOS starts.
    2) Tracing time
       This is the time which shows the working time of the user.
    3) Idle time
       This time shows how long the user has not been working while KNOSSOS was running.


- Multiresolution

    KNOSSOS now supports dynamic switching between datasets sampled at different resolutions. This
    allows zooming out much further than before to get an overview of a complete large dataset.
    This feature requires all datasets to reside in folders with identical names except for the
    trailing magnification specifier _magX, where X is an integer denoting the factor by which the
    data has been downsampled. KNOSSOS searches for datasets following this naming convention in the
    same folder as the current dataset.
    The feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by unchecking "Lock dataset to current mag"
    in "View" -> "Zoom and Multires".
