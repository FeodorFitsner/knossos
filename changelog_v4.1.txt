=  KNOSSOS V4.1 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data. It was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology, connectivity and volume.

-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: 24th January 2014

Project host: https://github.com/knossos-project/

Roadmap:
v4.2:
- 3D visualization of segmentation
- Support for Google and WebKNOSSOS datasets

----------------------------------
-  Known Bugs                    -
----------------------------------

- The Python scripting interface is still experimental at the moment.

----------------------------------
-  Bug fixes                     -
----------------------------------

- Annotation time will not reduce anymore when running KNOSSOS too long.

----------------------------------
-  Features                      -
----------------------------------

Dataset:
- The KNOSSOS cuber is now available. It allows easy conversion from image stacks to KNOSSOS datasets. Currently supported file formats: tif, png and jpeg.
- KNOSSOS now remembers your last used datasets and displays identifying information about them.
- Datasets can now be loaded by specifying a .conf file. Specifying a dataset folder is still supported.
- Two streaming datasets of the mouse retina are now shipped with KNOSSOS.
- Changing the Supercube edge size does not require a restart anymore.

Segmentation:
The segmentation feature allows to annotate the volume of neurons where skeletonization only reconstructs morphology and connectivity.
- Activate this feature at 'Edit Skeleton' -> 'Segmentation Mode'. The settings for it can be found at 'Windows' -> 'Annotation Window' -> 'Segmentation'.
- The Brush tool is used to perform original segmentation or to correct existing segmentations.
- The Merge tool is used to connect or disconnect existing segmentation objects.
- We support segmentation data in the form of raw 64-bit images compressed with google-snappy.

Skeletonization:
- The new Simple Tracing Mode prevents annotation mistakes through reduced functionality.
  Turned-off Features are: creating a new tree, placing unconnected nodes and creating cycles within the skeleton.
  You can deactivate Simple Tracing Mode at 'Edit Skeleton'.
- The Python scrpting interface can now be used to deploy custom plugins written in Python.
- Node comments can be displayed in the orthogonal viewports by enabling 'show node comments' at 'Windows' -> 'Viewport Settings' -> 'Slice Plane Viewports'.

----------------------------------
-  Changes                       -
----------------------------------

- Skeleton files (.nml-files) will still be supported continuously, but the new KNOSSOS annotation file (.k.zip) is now the default file type.
- The former 'Comment Settings' Window has been moved to the 'Comments' tab in the Annotation Window. You can define comment shortcuts from F1 - F10.
- The table row size within the Annotation Window has been reduced to display more rows.
- The annotation time is now displayed at the bottom right corner.
- Arbitrary viewport orientation now needs to be enabled at 'Windows' -> 'Viewport Settings' -> 'Slice Plane Viewports'.
