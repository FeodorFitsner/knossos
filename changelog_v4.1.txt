==================================
=  KNOSSOS V4.1 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data. It was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology, connectivity and volume.

----------------------------------
-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: 24th January 2014

Homepage: https://knossostool.org/
Project host: https://github.com/knossos-project/

Upcoming features and improvements:
- 3D visualization of segmentation with volume rendering
- Improved loader with support for several different dataset sources
- GPU-based data slicing (major perfomance increase, better quality for arbitrary views)

----------------------------------
-  Bug fixes                     -
----------------------------------

- Annotation time will not reduce anymore when running KNOSSOS too long.
- Resolved several crash conditions. 
- KNOSSOS now works with node IDs up to 4e9.
- Node selection difficulties fixed.
- Comment modification working properly again.

----------------------------------
-  Features                      -
----------------------------------

Dataset:
- A new KNOSSOS cuber in Python is now available. It allows easy conversion from image stacks to KNOSSOS datasets. Currently supported file formats: tif, png and jpeg.
- KNOSSOS now remembers your last used datasets and displays identifying information about them.
- Datasets can now be loaded by specifying a .conf file. Specifying a dataset folder is still supported.
- Two streaming datasets of the mouse retina are now shipped with KNOSSOS.
- Changing the Supercube edge size does not require a restart anymore.

Segmentation:
The segmentation feature allows to annotate the volume of neurons where skeletonization only reconstructs morphology and connectivity.
- Activate this feature at 'Edit Skeleton' -> 'Segmentation Mode'. The settings for it can be found at 'Windows' -> 'Annotation Window' -> 'Segmentation'.
- The Brush tool is used to perform original segmentation or to correct existing segmentations.
    - Edited cubes can be saved and loaded as part of the annotation file. 
- The Merge tool is used to connect or disconnect existing 64bit int segmentation objects. 
    - The result can be saved and loaded as a ›mergelist‹ as part of the annotation file. 
- We support segmentation data in the form of raw 64-bit matrices optionally compressed with google-snappy and zip.

Skeletonization:
- The new Simple Tracing Mode prevents annotation mistakes through reduced functionality.
  Turned-off Features are: creating a new tree, placing unconnected nodes and creating cycles within the skeleton.
  You can deactivate Simple Tracing Mode at 'Edit Skeleton'.
- KNOSSOS now supports >5e6 nodes (loading, saving, and parallel visualization of up to 500k nodes).
- Node comments can be displayed in the orthogonal viewports by enabling 'show node comments' at 'Windows' -> 'Viewport Settings' -> 'Slice Plane Viewports'.

Python plugin interface (experimental):
- KNOSSOS is now fully scriptable through PythonQT and additional functionality can be added with pure Python code.
- A Python plugin repository will be available on the KNOSSOS website soon.

----------------------------------
-  Changes                       -
----------------------------------

- Skeleton files (.nml-files) will still be supported continuously, but the new KNOSSOS annotation file (.k.zip) is now the default file type.
- The former 'Comment Settings' Window has been moved to the 'Comments' tab in the Annotation Window. You can define comment shortcuts from F1 - F10.
- The table row size within the Annotation Window has been reduced to display more rows.
- The annotation time is now displayed at the bottom right corner.
- Arbitrary viewport orientation now needs to be enabled at 'Windows' -> 'Viewport Settings' -> 'Slice Plane Viewports'.
- Both tabs for the heidelbrain integration have been merged.
