=  KNOSSOS V4.0 - Change Log     =
==================================

KNOSSOS is a software tool for the visualization and annotation of 3D image data and was developed for the rapid reconstruction of neural morphology and connectivity.

-  General Information           -
----------------------------------

Release Date: Date 03.06.2014

KNOSSOS 4.0 is a milestone release with a completely reworked graphical user interface based on
the QT framework.

Homepage: http://www.knossostool.org/
Project host: https://github.com/knossos-project/

Roadmap:
v4.1:
- Interactive Python scripting
- Volume annotation and visualization of large scale segmentations


----------------------------------
-  Known Bugs                    -
----------------------------------


----------------------------------
-  Quality                       -
----------------------------------

- Nicer look and feel
- Native file dialogs and ui elements
- Restructured menu:
  - Icons and shortcut information in the menu bar
  - Current workmodes are marked with a check
  - A Toolbar with a collection of important widgets
  - Restructured Viewport Settings Widget
- Tooltips
- Integrated documentation
- Unsaved changes are indicated with an (*) in the titlebar

----------------------------------
-  Features                      -
----------------------------------

Tracing:
- Integration of client-server based task management (with a Python django backend), that allows annotators to efficiently submit
their tracings to a database.
- Extensive filtering and listing of trees and nodes (with regular expression support) based on comments and other properties.
- Visual selection and operations on groups of nodes in all viewports.
- Show only selected trees.

Dataset:
- Real time arbitrary angle slicing for voxel data (use l or k for rotations).
- Datasets can now be streamed from remote server locations (http based, works well for connection speeds > 10 MBit/s with compression)
- Datasets can be compressed (each datacube individually) with JPG2000 with real time decompression during the navigation (multi-threaded).
Typical values for 3D EM datasets without obvious compression artefacts are ~1 bit / voxel. Lossless compression is also supported.
- On-the-fly dataset changes possible under File->Load Dataset, no more Python Launcher required.
- KNOSSOS remembers the last used dataset and loads it on launching.

Skeleton:
- Multiple skeletons can now be loaded at the same time.
- Load Skeletons by drag'n dropping them into KNOSSOS.

----------------------------------
-  Changes                       -
----------------------------------

- The Python Launcher has been removed.
- Moving Viewports around now works with CTRL+Alt+left mouse drag
- The synchonization of multiple KNOSSOS instances is currently not supported any more
- The format for custom preferences is now saved in a key value file structure (.conf)
- Default Folder for Skeleton Files is now in the standard data location (i.e for Windows: %AppData%/MPIMF and for Linux: /home/user/.local/share/data/MPIMF)
- A Mac OS X Version (>= version 10.9) will be available soon.
- Debian Packages for Linux (Tested on Ubuntu [i386/amd64] (>= version 12))
